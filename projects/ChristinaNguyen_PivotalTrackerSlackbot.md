Pivotal Tracker Slackbot and Rust/Elm documentation
# Project URL:

[Pivotal Tracker Slackbot](https://github.com/joelhmarquez/pivotaltracker-slackbot) / [Rust Tutorial](https://github.com/rust-lang/book) / [Elm Tutorial](https://github.com/evancz/guide.elm-lang.org)

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences): 

Joel and I are going to create a Slackbot that can interact with the Pivotal Tracker API. The Slackbot can get stories' statuses and push updates.

For the guides, I'm mainly going to fix typos, inconsistencies, or confusing snippets.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences): 

Our team for another class communicates over Slack, but we're required to track progress on Pivotal Tracker, so we want to make updates there whenever we talk to each other on Slack.

I am trying to learn Rust and Elm, and I think documentation / tutorials / examples are important in learning how to use a language.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences): 

The Slackbot will make the project easier to maintain and track since we won't have to update in both Slack and Pivotal Tracker. 

Edits to tutorials can help new users on board to the language, which can greatly affect how much traction new languages gain.
