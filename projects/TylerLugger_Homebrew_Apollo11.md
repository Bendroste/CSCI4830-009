## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
For my open source contribution project, I plan to contribute to two different projects on github. The first is Homebrew, the packagage manager for macOS that I use very frequently, there are issues frequenly posted to this project that I could potentially help with. The other project is the original Apollo 11 source code which has been added to github for everyone to see, this project has several issues requiring proofs for people to compare the code online with the original scanned documents. These contributions are small but help in the main goal of the project.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
Assisting the homebrew project is meaningful to me because it allows me to give back to the packagae manager that I have used for free for so long. The Apollo 11 project is meaningful to me beause of my interest in aerospace; I originally started at this university as an aerospace engineering major because of my fasination with things like the original Apollo 11 mission. This allows me to have a connecton with that field in my own unique way. 

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
Contributions to the Homebrew project are welcome no matter how large or small. An merged pull request seen here: https://github.com/homebrew/brew/pull/2276 shows how even a small typo fix in a comment is greatly appreciated to keep the homebrew project running. Contributions to the Apollo project will also allow the project to remain a strong reference project for an important piece of history.
