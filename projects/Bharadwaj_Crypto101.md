# Project URL:

## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
There are a lot of requests for content to include in the book started by https://www.crypto101.io/ like AES and DES in detail. There are new requests often and I am going to write as much as I can.

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
When I wanted to learn cryptography on my own, it was difficult to find one source that is suitable for all levels of understanding. This book is being written to address this specific concern and I want beginners to not feel discouraged due to the lack of an easier guide.

## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
The project was stared 3 years ago but it still has a lot of missing content that is not only, according to me, is really important but also requested by the users. I think this would be a really good boost if I reignite this so that others can also start contributing again.
