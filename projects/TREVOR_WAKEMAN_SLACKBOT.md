## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
  This project was recently created by a friend and I, for our friend groups slack.
  One of the main purposes of the bot is to process stats for a game that we all
  play and we have added some basic data pulls that process and return stats.
  I would like to continue adding statistics that our friend group will find amusing or useful
  possibly starting with overall games played (which was requested by a user).

## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
  This project is meaningful to me just because it is used by close friends and
  can quickly provide useful information for a game I am passionate about. In addition
  this project is a fun and useful project to learn and maintain python. 
## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
  This particular contribution would help the project by showing and comparing how much time
  people have wasted on the game and also help validate other stats provided by the bot.
