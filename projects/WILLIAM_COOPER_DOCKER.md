## Planned contribution (1-3 sentences):
I plan to learn the basics of the GO language and then make a contribution to the Docker code. If this proves to be difficult I could also contribute documentation.
## Why this project is meaningful to me (1-3 sentences):
I am interested in learning the GO language and this is a great opportunity to do so. Further, I am interested in containers and would like to learn more about their mechanics and uses by looking through their code base.
## Why this contribution is meaningful to the project (1-3 sentences):
Docker appears to be amenable to less experienced contributors. I can first make a basic contribution to the code of the project, and also lay the foundation to make further more meaningful contributions in the future.
